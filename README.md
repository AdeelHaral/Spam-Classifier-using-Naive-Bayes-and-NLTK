# Spam-Classifier-using-Naive-Bayes-and-NLTK
This project implements a spam classifier using the SMS Spam Collection dataset. The classifier is built using NLTK for text preprocessing, a lemmatizer for word normalization, and a Naive Bayes classifier for prediction. The model is trained to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) messages in text data.
**Key Features:**

Utilizes NLTK for text preprocessing and lemmatization.
Implements a Naive Bayes classifier for spam detection.
Evaluates the model using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.
**Dependencies**:

nltk
pandas
scikit-learn
