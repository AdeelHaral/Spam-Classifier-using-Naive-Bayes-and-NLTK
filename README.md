# Spam-Classifier-using-Naive-Bayes-and-NLTK
This project implements a spam classifier using the SMS Spam Collection dataset. The classifier is built using NLTK for text preprocessing, a lemmatizer for word normalization, and a Naive Bayes classifier for prediction. The model is trained to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) messages in text data.
